\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {2.1}{\ignorespaces Schematic diagram showing the dipole-dipole interaction between a QS and a CS, separated by a distance $R$. When an external field, $\mathaccentV {vec}17EE_\text {EXT}$, is applied, a dipole moment, $\mathaccentV {vec}17EP_\text {QS}$, is induced in the QS, generating a field. The CS thus experiences this dipole field in addition to the external field, and we denote the total field felt by the CS as $\mathaccentV {vec}17EE_\text {CS}$. Similarly, due to $\mathaccentV {vec}17EE_\text {CS}$, a dipole field is generated in the CS which is in turn felt by the QS in addition to $\mathaccentV {vec}17EE_\text {EXT}$, and we denote the total field felt by the QS as $\mathaccentV {vec}17EE_\text {QS}$. In this way, the QS and CS dynamics are coupled through the external field.\relax }}{5}{figure.caption.3}
